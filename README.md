peakflow-peerupdate
===================
This script helps you keep your peer definitions up to date in Peakflow. That
includes a Managed Object per peer and interface rules to match private network
interconnect interfaces.

It uses the pypeakflow library to communicate with Peakflow, so make sure you
have that.
